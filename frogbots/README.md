# what is frogbots

these are trading bots that interact with various cosmos blockchains. focus will be to use a portion of mint/royalties proceeds to fund the bots on regular and automated intervals

# what is a bot

in this case, a bot is just some code that executes by itself. the code will be various scripts for querying, transferring, and trading on blockchains

# which blockchains (for now)

the two blockchains (for now) that these frogbots need to interact with are: stargaze and osmosis

This might mean I need to uses the following two CLI tools: osmosd and starsd

# frogbots

transfer_n_trade_bot - transfers stars from stargaze to osmosis, buys osmosis on the osmosis blockchain

buy_bot - buys xyz coin on start.cooking
