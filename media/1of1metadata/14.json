    "description": "ðŸš¬ This sub collection of smoking frogs was inspired by the infamous Frogstar from the Smoker's Club. 20% of the proceeds from the collection will go straight to the smoker's club treasury for whatever crazy stuff Timius, Frogstar and the rest of the Smoker's Club gang got going on at any given time.ðŸš¬ \n\nðŸ“œWhat is the smoker's club?ðŸ“œ \nThe Smoker's club is a community that leverages the power of the metadata embedded inside nft collections to create a 'cross-chain' nft collection. If you want to be part of the club, you need to hold an nft with an officially approved trait, which is voted on *by the community* to deem that trait worthy, so one of the utilities in holding a smoker is that you become one of the curators of a growing meta collection based on a single concept.
